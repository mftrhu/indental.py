# indental.py

Despite the name, this repository contains Python versions of the parsers for both the [Indental][] **and** [Tablatal][] data formats.  They are more or less straight-up ports of the Javascript implementations from [XXIIVV/Oscean][].  Like the originals, they are MIT-licensed.

[Indental]: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Indental
[Tablatal]: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Tablatal
[XXIIVV/Oscean]: https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean

`indental.el` also provides a trivial - and yet buggy - Emacs major mode for editing Indental files, `indental-mode`.
